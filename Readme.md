# AI-Powered Quiz System with Computer Vision Integration

Welcome to the AI-Powered Quiz System! This project leverages AI models to generate, evaluate, and translate quiz questions and answers dynamically, with a special focus on accessibility for the deaf and dumb community.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI Quiz Generation:** Automatically generate quiz questions using AI models.
- **Real-time Evaluation:** Evaluate answers instantly using pre-trained models.
- **Language Translation:** Translate quizzes into multiple languages for broader accessibility.
- **Computer Vision Integration:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to enhance AI-powered quiz interactions.
- **Accessibility for the Deaf and Dumb Community:** Designed with features to support visual-based quizzes and AI-powered text-to-sign language integration.
- **Interactive Interface:** Seamlessly integrates AI functionalities within Jupyter notebooks.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The AI-Powered Quiz System aims to:
- Automate quiz creation and evaluation using AI and machine learning models.
- Integrate computer vision to recognize and process visual data for quiz interactions.
- Provide multilingual support through AI-based translations.
- Support the deaf and dumb community by offering AI-powered sign language recognition and text-to-sign language translation.
- Enhance user engagement with AI-driven feedback and dynamic quizzes.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `AI_quizzes_translation.ipynb`: Handles quiz translation workflows.
- `AI_Quizzes1.ipynb`: Contains the core quiz generation and evaluation logic.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃 Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the desired notebook (`AI_quizzes_translation.ipynb` or `AI_Quizzes1.ipynb`).
3. Run cells step by step to generate and evaluate quizzes.
